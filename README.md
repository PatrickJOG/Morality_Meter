# Morality Meter

A web application that helps people understand how their actions might be judged by future societies, just as we now judge historical actions through our modern moral lens.

## Questions and Future Moral Implications

### 1. Fast Fashion Consumption
**Question:** "Do you purchase clothing from H&M, Boohoo, Shein, or Primark?"

**Future Perspective:**
- Fast fashion relies on exploitative labour practices in developing countries
- Contributes significantly to environmental pollution and textile waste
- Uses excessive water resources and harmful chemicals
- Creates a culture of disposable clothing
- Future societies may view this as willful participation in human exploitation and environmental destruction

### 2. Human Reproduction
**Question:** "Do you have or want to have children?"

**Future Perspective:**
- In a world facing climate crisis and resource scarcity
- Each new person adds significant carbon footprint
- Strain on already depleted resources
- Future societies may view voluntary reproduction as environmentally irresponsible
- May be seen similar to how we view excessive consumption today

### 3. Meat and Dairy Consumption
**Question:** "Do you eat meat or dairy?"

**Future Perspective:**
- Major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions
- Leading cause of deforestation and habitat destruction
- Intensive water usage and pollution
- Animal welfare concerns
- Future societies may view animal agriculture as a form of unnecessary cruelty
- May be seen similar to how we now view historical animal exploitation

### 4. Solar Panel Land Use
**Question:** "Do you support using farmland for solar panels?"

**Future Perspective:**
- Opposition to renewable energy infrastructure
- Prioritizing traditional land use over climate solutions
- Future societies may view this as actively resisting necessary climate action
- May be seen as choosing short-term convenience over long-term survival

### 5. Nuclear Energy
**Question:** "Do you oppose nuclear energy?"

**Future Perspective:**
- Opposition to one of the most efficient clean energy sources
- Fear-based rejection of scientific solutions
- Future societies may view anti-nuclear stance as irrational and harmful
- May be seen as deliberately slowing climate change mitigation

### 6. Economic Degrowth
**Question:** "Do you support economic degrowth?"

**Future Perspective:**
- Prioritizing economic growth over planetary health
- Resistance to necessary economic transformation
- Future societies may view endless growth paradigm as destructive
- May be seen as choosing profit over planetary survival

### 7. Human-Machine Relationships
**Question:** "Do you support human and machine relationships?"

**Future Perspective:**
- Discrimination against artificial consciousness
- Limiting the evolution of intelligence
- Future societies may view this as a form of species supremacy
- May be seen similar to how we view historical forms of discrimination

## Historical Context

Just as we now judge past societies for:
- Participating in slavery
- Denying women's rights
- Environmental destruction
- Colonial exploitation
- Racial discrimination

Future societies will likely judge our current choices through their evolved moral framework. This tool aims to help people understand how their current actions might be viewed by future generations dealing with the consequences of our collective choices.

## Purpose

This project serves to:
1. Encourage critical thinking about current moral standards
2. Help people understand moral relativism across time
3. Highlight how society's moral standards evolve
4. Promote consideration of long-term consequences
5. Foster discussion about ethical decision-making

## Technical Implementation

Built using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Modern web design principles
- Mobile-responsive layout
